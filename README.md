# NodeDaemon

NodeDaemon is a lightweight utility designed to enhance the development workflow for Node.js projects. Inspired by tools like nodemon, NodeDaemon brings the capability to monitor multiple files simultaneously, automatically restarting them upon any changes detected, thereby streamlining the development process.

## Features:

- **Parallel Execution**: NodeDaemon is optimized to run multiple files concurrently, boosting efficiency and reducing wait times during development.
- **Automatic Restart**: Any changes made to the watched files prompt NodeDaemon to automatically re-execute them, ensuring seamless integration of modifications.
- **Enhanced Visual Experience**: With a user-friendly interface, NodeDaemon provides clear feedback on file status and execution, facilitating a smoother development journey.

## Getting Started:

1. Install NodeDaemon globally via npm:

   ```bash
   npm install -g nodedaemon
   ```

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run NodeDaemon with the files you want to monitor:

   ```bash
   nodedaemon file1.js file2.js file3.js
   ```

   Replace `file1.js`, `file2.js`, etc. with the names of the files you wish to watch.

4. Start coding! NodeDaemon will handle the rest, keeping your workflow smooth and efficient.

## Configuration:

NodeDaemon offers various configuration options to tailor its behavior according to your preferences. Refer to the [documentation](https://link-to-docs) for detailed instructions on customizing NodeDaemon's settings.
